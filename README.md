## Summary

I built this application to learn how to operate React JS. I know React is an industry standard for front end development and I know it is very important to be familiar using these tools.

I started from scratch when building this app. I learned all about how React manipulates the virtual dom to display a web application. The syntax was very different from what I have done before, but now that I am more comfortable with it I see how powerful it can be.

The specifics of what I learned are the following:

> React Components

> React Events, State, Props & Conditional Rendering

> Lifestyle Methods

> Styling React with Bootstrap 4

> Deployment to Heroku
